The [Epic Ride Weather](/epic-ride-weather/) app, previously only available for Android, was released today for iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad.

Epic Ride Weather provides precise weather forecasts for every 10 minutes of ride time based on a route that you provide from Strava, Runkeeper or GPX file.  With timing information and GPS coordinates, a projection of weather over the duration of your ride is visually presented within the app:


<div class="row bottom-buffer-sm">
<div class="col-xs-6"><img alt="Epic Ride Weather app" src="/epic-ride-weather/images/ios-ride-weather.png" class="border center" width="240px" /></div>
<div class="col-xs-6"><img alt="Epic Ride Weather app" src="/epic-ride-weather/images/ios-ride-weather-wind.png" class="border center" width="240px"/></div>
</div>

Forecasts for temperature (actual and feels-like) and precipitation (probability and intensity) are shown, as well as predicted wind speed and direction.
