Welcome to Green's Opinion, a site by [David Green](about).  Here are some of my projects:

### [GreenBeans](https://github.com/greensopinion/greenbeans)

A personal finance app, designed for simplicity and security.

* Strong encryption and local data only - no need to [trust the cloud](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/) with your information.
* Open source, so that you can see how it works.
* For Mac and Windows
