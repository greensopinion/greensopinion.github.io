I'm David Green, passionate about software and how it can make the world a better place.

I'm creator of [Mylyn WikiText](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/WikiText), a software library and tools for rendering, transforming and manipulating
Markdown, CommonMark, Asciidoc, Textile, HTML, Docbook, Dita, and may other forms of rich text.

I'm currently VP of Architecture for [Tasktop](http://tasktop.com), where we are connecting the world of software delivery. Some great examples of that are [how we connect the supply chain for BMW](http://www.tasktop.com/content/blog-entry/how-code-your-car-paving-future-software-delivery), and [an integrating Slack chatbot](http://www.tasktop.com/content/blog-entry/introducing-taskbot-integrating-chatbot).  

I work with an incredible team, and love what I do.  My languages of choice are Java and JavaScript, but I am happy to take on whatever technologies deliver the greatest business value with the least waste.
