<p>I had a great time at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_November_2009/Vancouver">Eclipse DemoCamp Vancouver 2009</a>.  There were some really interesting talks, and the pace was good with 9 minutes per presentation.  In particular I was really impressed by a presentation by Emerson Murphy-Hill titled <cite>Identifying Code Smells in Eclipse</cite>.  Emerson demo'd a tool which augments the Java source editor with ambient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smell</a> decorations.  Neat stuff.</p><p>Anyone that is interested can find <a href="https://textile-j.dev.java.net/CrowdsourcingDocumentation.pdf">my slides on Crowdsourcing Documentation here</a>.  In a nutshell I presented on how Mylyn WikiText can enable the use of a wiki (such as <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org">EclipsePedia</a>) for creating and maintaining documentation while still publishing to other formats, such as the Eclipse help system.  This idea is evolving within discussions by the Eclipse Architecture Council on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/283734">bug 283734: Documentation Best Practices</a>.</p>
