Today I became an Eclipse Foundation <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/membership/become_a_member/committer.php">Committer Member</a>.  This will enable me to vote in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/elections/">2009 Eclipse Foundation Elections</a>.<br /><br />Being committed (no pun intended) to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn WikiText</a> project and being interested in projects such as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swtbot/">SWTBot</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> (for Cocoa) I believe that small and innovative projects should be well-represented on the Eclipse Foundation board. <br /><br />Having known and worked with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/elections/candidate.php?year=2009&amp;id=kersten">Mik Kersten</a> in various ways over the past few years, I am constantly surprised by his breadth of knowledge, leadership, and grass-roots understanding of the needs of developers and committers.  I've seen Mik uphold a high level of integrity and demonstrate consistent follow-through.  I know that he has a solid understanding of what is needed by such projects and is capable of using his board experience and influence to make a difference.
