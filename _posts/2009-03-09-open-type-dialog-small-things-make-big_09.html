I'm a big fan of attention to detail when creating tooling for developers.  Our brains are tuned to notice the smallest perceptible visual clues.  We can absorb a lot of information with the right visual cues, however presenting that information without adding clutter to an IDE is a real challenge.<br /><br />The JDT team has mangaged to improve the Open Type dialog in Eclipse 3.5 without falling into the trap of a cluttered interface:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vw9l2nnub6c/SbV9A8aZHaI/AAAAAAAAADI/uSxBSPXvcg4/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 340px;" src="/images/blog/2009-03-09/picture_1.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311288790723665314" /></a><br /><br />Notice how a bold font is being used to identify regions of text that match the filter.  The JDT team is using <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.5M4-200812111908/eclipse-news-M4.html">a new platform feature</a> where multiple fonts can be used in one cell.  Here's what it used to look like:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vw9l2nnub6c/SbV9RQxjJmI/AAAAAAAAADQ/hM5Dc2csl9M/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 340px;" src="/images/blog/2009-03-09/picture_2.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311289071067407970" /></a><br /><br />The best thing about this new feature is that my brain doesn't have to work harder to know more -- it's immediately evident to me which matches are better and why without having to think about it.<br /><br />The importance of eliminating and minimizing visual noise is evidenced by products such as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn</a> that are designed to do just that: filter out what you don't need.  <div><br /></div><div>Kudos to the JDT team for raising the bar.  I can't wait for Eclipse 3.5 Galileo to be released this summer.</div>
