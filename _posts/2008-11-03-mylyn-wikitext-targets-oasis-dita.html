<div>Wiki content has become increasingly popular within the <a href="http://dita.xml.org/">DITA community</a>, as evidenced by the <a href="http://development.lombardi.com/?p=68">recent announcement</a> of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dita2wiki/">DITA2Wiki</a> open source project.  While most of these projects enable DITA-to-wiki conversions, community interest has been expressed for full-cycle wiki-DITA-wiki transformation capability.  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn WikiText</a> hopes to close this loop with the addition of its support for DITA output.  Mylyn WikiText can now create <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dita">OASIS DITA</a> as output from wiki markup.</div><br /><div>Mylyn WikiText provides a flexible architecture supporting multiple wiki markup languages.  This provides organizations with many options when considering a DITA toolchain, whether it be a one-time conversion of existing wiki assets to DITA, or as an integrated part of a publishing process.  Currently supported are MediaWiki, Textile, Confluence, TWiki and TracWiki.</div><br /><div>I am also very excited about the recent  <a href="http://www.dita-op.org/">DITA Open Platform project</a>, which aims to enable Eclipse as a full-fledged DITA authoring and publishing platform.  With the capabilities provided by Mylyn WikiText and DITA-op, Eclipse as a platform becomes a compelling cross-platform DITA authoring toolset.</div><br /><div>Mylyn WikiText originated from <a href="https://textile-j.dev.java.net/">Textile-J</a>, where parsing capabilities evolved to support more than 5 wiki markup languages, conversion of wikitext to DocBook, integrated support for the Ant build system and first-class integration with the Eclipse platform.</div><br /><div>Mylyn WikiText is looking for community feedback on wikitext to DITA conversion.  Please feel free to <a href="mailto:dgreen99@gmail.com">contact me directly via email</a> or <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?classification=Tools">post a bug or enhancement request</a> to the WikiText component of the Mylyn project.</div>
