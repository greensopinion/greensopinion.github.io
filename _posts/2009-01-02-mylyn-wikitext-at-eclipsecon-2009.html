<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=608">WikiText will be at EcilpseCon 2009</a> in Santa Clara, California.  The presentation time was expanded to allow for more coverage of WikiText -- so if there's something specific that you'd like to hear about please let me know.  <div><br /></div><div>The WikiText presentation is included in a session titled "<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=708">50 minutes towards a better you</a>".  Don't ask me about the title -- I don't know if WikiText will make you a better person or not.  I'm very excited to be there presenting this new technology alongside Steffen Pingel, who will be providing a Mylyn connector crash course.</div>
