<p>Momentum is building around documentation best-practices at Eclipse.  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit">EGit</a>, Eclipse's Git integration project, <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg00936.html">recently became</a> the latest project to adopt a crowdsourcing approach to documentation, and is reaping the benefits: in one day they've already seen the contribution of <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Git_For_Eclipse_Users">Git for Eclipse Users</a> from Alex Blewitt.</p><p>They are able to do this by taking advantage a new feature of the latest <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/WikiText">Mylyn WikiText</a>, which can generate Eclipse help directly from a wiki.  While it was possible to process individual pages before, now Mylyn WikiText makes it easy to process multiple wiki pages at once while automatically downloading images, maintaining page cross-references, and building a unified table of contents.</p><p>You can learn more about crowdsourcing documentation at EclipseCon 2010, where Chris Aniszczyk  and I are co-presenting <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/sessions?id=1285">Documentation: Single-Sourcing, Crowd-Sourcing And Other Voodoo</a>.  If you can't wait two weeks, you can find out how they're doing it at EGit from their <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Documentation">contributor guide</a>.</p><p><em>Updated 4/21/2010:</em> Thanks to Chris, a working example with documentation and source is available at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/DocumentationGuidelines/CrowdSourcingExample">DocumentationGuidelines/CrowdSourcingExample</a></p>
