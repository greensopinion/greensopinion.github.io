<p>Recently I blogged about <a href="http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2009/04/galileo-icu4j-requirement-is-painful.html">the pain of moving to ICU4J</a>, lamenting the fact that using NLS instead of ResourceBundle would require me to change the keys in my resource bundles.  After much consideration and <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=1482979278030787271&postID=5052361975001061519">the advice of knowledgeable people</a>, I decided that moving to NLS was the way to go.  After changing resource bundle keys across the board, I expected that translations to other languages would need their corresponding keys changed as well.  Not so.  Apparently <a href="http://babel.eclipse.org/babel/">Babel</a> can magically handle such refactorings, with the help of a mystery user named 'Babel Syncup'.  I wonder what else it can do.</p><p>The <a href="http://babel.eclipse.org/babel/">Eclipse Babel</a> project is truly impressive.  Kudos to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/babel/development/">Babel team</a> for thinking ahead.</p>
