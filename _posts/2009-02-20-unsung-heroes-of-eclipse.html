<p>I'm glad to see a Top Contributor category in the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/eclipseawards/index.php">Eclipse Community Awards</a> that takes into account more than just code contributions.  It's all too easy to lavish praise and recognition on those who contribute code -- but what about the others?  The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn WikiText</a> project has been lucky to garner the attention of individuals who spend their own time installing, testing, performing quality assurance, and collaborating on Bugzilla.</p><p>In particular I'd like to thank Jörg Thönnes of Aachen, Germany for the many hours that he <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?classification=Mylyn&email1=joerg.thoennes%40web.de&emailassigned_to1=1&emailcc1=1&emaillongdesc1=1&emailreporter1=1&emailtype1=substring&list_id=8017319&query_format=advanced">has contributed</a> in making Mylyn WikiText a better product.</p>
