<p>I've been using the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/profiler">NetBeans profiler</a> to help me develop Eclipse plug-ins.  A couple of years ago I tried TPTP (Eclipse Test and Performance Tools Platform), but found it extremely difficult to configure and it couldn't compete with Sun's <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=90">dynamic bytecode instrumentation technology</a>.  Today I thought I'd give TPTP another go.  The first link that I clicked on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/index.php">TPTP homepage</a> was the Getting Started link, and this is what I got:</p><br /><p><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; border: 0px;" src="/images/blog/2009-02-13/picture_1.png" border="0" alt="Popup dialog with message: Sorry but this page is not currently viewable in Safari" /></p><p>Given that Safari and <a href="http://webkit.org/">WebKit</a> are largely acclaimed as being some of the most advanced web technology available, it seems that the TPTP team really doesn't want me to use their profiler.  I'll check back later -- in the meantime I'll continue using NetBeans to profile Eclipse.</p>
