<p>Peter Friese has upped the stakes in his latest article on <a href="http://www.peterfriese.de/advanced-wikitext/">Advanced WikiText</a>.  Friese tackles tough topics, such as how to optimize team collaboration with multiple source files and integrating with a DocBook toolchain.  Great article, a must-read for those who are authoring documentation.</p>
