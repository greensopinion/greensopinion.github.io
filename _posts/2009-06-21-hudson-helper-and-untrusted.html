<p>If you're using a self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by your own certificate authority with the <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net">Hudson Continuous Integration Server</a> then you may be wondering how to get your iPhone to trust your certificate.  Well, you're in luck because Benjamin Boksa has written an excellent tutorial explaining how to do just that: <a href="http://blog.boksa.de/2009/06/18/iphone-os-30-root-certificate-authority-installation/">iPhone OS 3.0 â€“ Root Certificate Authority installation</a>.  After following the tutorial you should be able to use <a href="http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2009/05/hudson-helper-hudson-on-your-iphone.html">Hudson Helper</a> with untrusted certs and your secure Hudson server.</p>
