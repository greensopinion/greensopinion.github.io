<p>I presented my session titled "<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009/sessions?id=608">WikiText: Generate Eclipse Help from Eclipsepedia</a>" (about <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn WikiText</a>) at EclipseCon 2009.  I had a lot of fun and lots of positive feedback.  If you're interested in the slides from my presentation, you can <a href="https://textile-j.dev.java.net/EclipseCon2009-WikiText.pdf">find them here</a>.  A couple of interesting experiences from EclipseCon:</p><h4>Trying Something New</h4><p>Before the presentation I saw the <a href="http://www.appleiphoneapps.com/2009/01/review-keynote-remote/">Keynote Remote</a> application for iPhone.  Thinking it would be fun, I tried it for the first time while presenting my session.  It turns out that to control slides you must swipe, which means that you need to know the orientation of your iPhone.  Every time you want to change slides you have to look at your phone.  Very distracting for both the presenter and the audience. </p><p>I learned the hard way something that I already knew: don't try anything new in a presentation!</p><h4>Twitter</h4><p>Twitter helped to create a <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23eclipsecon">buzz</a> both before, during and after my session.  The best thing about it for me was that I got immediate feedback on my presentation even before it was over.</p><h4>iPhone Alarm</h4><p>Beware that your iPhone alarm will sound even if the quiet switch has been activated.  I discovered this design feature as Mike Milinkovich, the executive director of the Eclipse foundation was presenting.  I think he was as surprised as me when the get-to-a-bomb-shelter-now siren sounded from my phone's alarm.  Sorry Mike!</p><br /><p><br />All in all I had a great time.  I highly recommend EclipseCon for those who wish to meet interesting people with a common focus and lots of ideas.<br /></p>
