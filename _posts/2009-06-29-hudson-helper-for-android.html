<p>Recently I <a href="http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2009/05/hudson-helper-hudson-on-your-iphone.html">launched Hudson Helper</a> for iPhone and iPod Touch, enabling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration">Continuous Integration</a> fans to stay in touch with their projects.  Android users can get in on the game now too, with Hudson Helper for Android.</p><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td align="center"><img  src="/images/blog/2009-06-29/hh_blog1.png" border="0" alt="Hudson Helper for Android"  /></td></tr></table><p>Hudson Helper for Android provides all of the same features as the iPhone version including support for multiple servers and authentication.  New for this version are build controls: start and stop builds right from your phone.  CI can be even more fun with shake-to-build and sound effects.</p><p>To get Hudson Helper for Android, search for 'Hudson Helper' in the Google Market on your Android device.</p>
