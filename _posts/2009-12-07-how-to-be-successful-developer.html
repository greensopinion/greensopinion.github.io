<p>I was recently asked for advice from a young student on how to become a successful software developer.  This is a complicated question.  I put some thought into it, and realized that every individual will become successful in different ways.  Here are some things that helped me:</p><ul><li>Always strive to improve yourself and learn more.</li><li>Share information freely with others &mdash; be generous.</li><li>Focus on developing good working relationships with your coworkers, both technical staff and others.</li><li>Effective communication, both written and spoken is crucial.</li><li>Get involved in open source.</li><li>Be precise.</li><li>Deliver on commitments, or if you need to renegotiate your commitments.</li><li>In everything that you do, do it with integrity.</li></ul><p>Almost none of these have anything to do with knowledge of technology.  I believe that social aspects have far more impact on success than anything else.  Of course  being knowledgeable helps too, however what's more important than knowing a specific technology is being able to pick up the knowledge that you need, when you need it.</p><p>A few things that I missed in my response because I take them for granted:</p><ul><li>Have passion for what you do.</li><li>Strive for excellence.</li><li>Avoid being self-righteous.</li></ul><p>I'm sure that there are many things that contribute to being successful.   I'd love to hear from others: what do you think are key contributing factors to becoming a successful software developer?</p>
