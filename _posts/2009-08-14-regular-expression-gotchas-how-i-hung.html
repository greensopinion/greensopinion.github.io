<p>Mylyn WikiText uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> to parse wiki markup.  For <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn">Mylyn</a> users, this means that your Bugzilla, JIRA and Trac bugs look good in the Eclipse UI.  With the Galileo release of Eclipse, Mylyn WikiText added automatic stack trace detection.<br />Little did I know that the regular expression that I wrote would <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283629">hang the Eclipse UI</a>.</p><p>The intention was to format stack traces using a monospace font to improve layout:</p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vw9l2nnub6c/SoXcSkLlrDI/AAAAAAAAAIg/IFpM-8KrwJw/s1600-h/Picture+6.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 179px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vw9l2nnub6c/SoXcSkLlrDI/AAAAAAAAAIg/IFpM-8KrwJw/s400/Picture+6.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5369940342217223218" /></a><p>Stack traces are detected by a regular expression.  The regex that I created for this purpose worked well in testing, however for some stack traces would pin the CPU at near 100%, hanging the Eclipse UI.  Here's what the regular expression looked like:</p><pre><code>([A-Za-z][a-z0-9_$]*)+</code></pre><p>Actually, the full regular expression is a lot bigger: </p><pre><code>\s*((((Caused by:\s+)|(at\s+))?([a-z][a-z0-9]*)(\.([a-z][a-z0-9]*))*\.([A-Za-z][a-z0-9_$]*)+((:\s+\w.*)|(\.((\<init\>)|([a-zA-Z0-9_$]+))\(.*?\)))?)|(\.\.\.\s\d+\smore))</code></pre><p>The regex segment attempts to match a camel-case Java class name.  What I didn't notice the first time around is that it contains nested greedy quantifiers.  For some input can cause the CPU spiral of death... not good news.</p><p>To fix the offending regular expression is simple: just eliminate any nested quantifiers.  My improved regular expression segment now looks like this:</p><pre><code>[A-Za-z][a-zA-Z0-9_$]*</code></pre><p>Two things that I learned from this experience:</p><ol><li>Never write a regular expression that nests greedy quantifiers.</li><li>Always ensure that testing involves sufficient diversity of input data.</li></ol>
