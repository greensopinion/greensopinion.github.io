Mik Kersten has writen a great article about WikiText and what it means for Mylyn users, titled <a href="http://tasktop.com/blog/?p=37">Rich Editing for Tasks via Mylyn WikiText</a>.  He really does a great job of capturing the essence behind Eclipse's powerful source editing features and how it was applied to the markup editing features of WikiText.
